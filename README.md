**Linear Algebra Concepts**  
- dependent and independent vectors  
    - Two vectors are linearly dependent if one vector can be expressed as linear combination of other vector, if not then they are independent.  
- Basis Vector  
    - A vector basis of a vector space is defined as a subset of vectors in that are linearly independent and span.
