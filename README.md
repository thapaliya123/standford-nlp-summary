# standford-nlp-summary
> Includes summary and assignments solution of [Stanford cs224n NLP with Deep Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/).

**NLP tools**  
- [Embedding Projector](https://projector.tensorflow.org/) 
- [Word2Vec Visualization](https://ronxin.github.io/wevi/)

**NLP terms**  
- WordNet  
- Word vectors  
- Vectors from annotated discrete properties
- Distributional signal / Distributional Semantics 
- self supervised

**Linear Algebra Concepts**  
- dependent and independent vectors  
    - Two vectors are linearly dependent if one vector can be expressed as linear combination of other vector, if not then they are independent.  
- Basis Vector  
    - A vector basis of a vector space is defined as a subset of vectors in that are linearly independent and span.
